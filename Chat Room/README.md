This is my chatroom project. I chose to implement a couple of extra feautres: changing colors on the chat
log, home buttons in the chat rooms, and a list of all the chat rooms on the home page. 

Everytime the button to make a new chatroom is called, the random generate creates a new path on the host 
to the chat room, and then when a message and name is called, a database is created the keeps track of
name of the room, name of the user, message, and time. The database is then constantly being querried for
messages to display. 

I couldn't get it to work with JSON dependencies, though I tried several times. So I transfered the files that worked for me, and installed the same dependencies that I used while working on it. I hope you don't have any trouble!

There are no bugs that I know of. I hope you enjoy it!
